A local band is suing a college Rugby Club over event flyers which incorrectly showed the name of the band as “Thunderthighs”.  The Rugby Club advised that they were just trying to build excitement and get a few students to come out and enjoy the band and fifty kegs of Beer.  Lead Singer “Dolly Molly” advised that it was disrespectful to the band and their fans. “Our band has worked very hard to craft an image for our show”.  The Rugby Club has issued an apology to the band in the campus newspaper.  Rugby Club president “Mo Beer” advised that they intended no image disrespect – we should have listed the correct name of the band;  “Big Mama and the Bad Boy Angels”.
