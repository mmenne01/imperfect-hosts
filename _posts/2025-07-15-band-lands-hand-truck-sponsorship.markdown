Imperfect hosts band is delighted to announce that it has landed a new sponsorship: “Ambidextrous hand trucks”.  Sponsorship occurred after the president of Ambidextrous hand trucks  was at a recent imperfect hosts gig.  He  noticed the old hand truck stage right and recognized it as a type I hand truck not made since the 1970’s.  Imperfect hosts related that the unit was found on the side of a local interstate and has been used ever since.  The president  then decided to present the band with a brand new “type II” hand truck.  Imperfect hosts roadie was very appreciative as not too many bands can boast of having two hand trucks.
