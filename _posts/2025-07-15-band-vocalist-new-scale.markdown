It was a very special night for a local band as their lead vocalist created a new scale while singing. Listeners were treated to the performance of a lifetime last Friday night. Imperfect hosts sources advise that the lead vocalist was constantly creating new "harmonic tones" throughout the performance.

Although this was not a first in music, singer is credited with a consistent special use of new scales; these included notes slightly above or below chord roots. According to Asian born guitarist "Wy Tune", the vocalist has had the special talent since joining early last year.

The club owner where the event occurred suggested that it was hard to observe the special "harmonic tones" as the instruments were very loud; he was confident though that the new scales were indeed created.
