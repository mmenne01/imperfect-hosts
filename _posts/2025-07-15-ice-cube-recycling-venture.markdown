A local Bass player has started a new company which hopes to recycle ice cubes.  The concept involves collecting ice cubes from bar glasses (after the gig) and then bringing them to his house for “recycling”.  Bass Player advised that he is currently working on a solution to keep the ice cubes from turning to water overnight.
